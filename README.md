# Flat File Blog Backend

This is a simple blog backend for managing blog posts without a database.

## Installation

To use it in your project, simply add a dependency on UPDATE/NAME
to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json`
file that just defines a dependency on UPDATE_NAME 1.x:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "dgunay/flat-file-blog": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

or 

`composer require dgunay/flat-file-blog`
